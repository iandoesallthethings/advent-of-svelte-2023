# Advent of Svelte 2023

Here's my frantic attempt to catch up on advent of svelte 2023 (because I only learned about it on
the 15th). I'm using this as an excuse to practice/showcase Svelte 5 and Bun, but since I'm so
behind, expect the visuals to be ROUGH.

## Dev
This project uses SvelteKit, Svelte 5, Tailwind, and Bun.

```bash
# Run the dev server
bun install
bun dev
```

## Building
```bash
bun run build
bun run preview # To preview the build
```

## Deployment
This project is set up to deploy to vercel out of the box. Just make sure to set the install and build commands in the gui. I should probably add a vercel.json file to make this easier tho ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
